# Fan Anthem API Reference Document

Fan Anthem is a new app that lets football fans upload original songs to their profiles and share with connected friends and member groups, with some hoping they'll score a firm favourite that's chanted from the terraces.

The following is a basic example of a reference document written by a Fan Anthem developer. It includes info on how sound files are uploaded to a user's own profile and how to get information on sound files for a user. 

See the final API documentation I created based on this information.

**Note:** Useful information has been purposely omitted to simulate a real-world scenario. A tech writer will use their experience as well as testing the API and asking developers for more info to complete the task.<br><br>
